# THEORY:
An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).
# PROCEDURE:
## Step 1: Prepare for Installation
Before you begin the installation of an operating system (OS) on your computer, it's important to prepare and gather the necessary materials and information. Here are the steps to prepare for OS installation:
### Check Hardware Compatibility:
Ensure that your computer's hardware meets the minimum requirements for the OS you plan to install. This includes CPU, RAM, storage, and graphics card specifications. You can usually find these requirements on the official website of the OS provider.  ![image](https://github.com/ASHWINKUMAR2903/OS-EX.2-INSTALLATION-OF-OS---CASE-STUDY/assets/119407186/f968435f-cb56-4129-91ed-1d8c5d929a5b)

### Backup Your Data:
Before proceeding, back up any important data on your computer to an external storage device or cloud service. The installation process can potentially lead to data loss or formatting of the existing storage.
### Create Installation Media:
Depending on the OS, you will need to create installation media. This can be a bootable USB drive or a DVD-ROM containing the OS installation files. For Windows, you can use the Windows Media Creation Tool to create a bootable USB drive. For Linux distributions, you can use tools like Rufus or Etcher.

## Step 2: BIOS/UEFI Configuration for OS Installation
### Access the BIOS/UEFI:
Start or restart your computer.
As soon as the computer begins to boot, look for on-screen prompts indicating which key or key combination to press to enter the BIOS/UEFI settings. Common keys include F2, Del, F12, Esc, or a key specific to your computer's manufacturer (e.g., Asus, HP, and Dell).        Press the designated key(s) repeatedly until the BIOS/UEFI setup   screen appears.
